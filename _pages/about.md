I'm Xiaozhong Sun, a Visiting Lecturer in the Department of City and Regional Planning at Cornell University. My research interests include:

- Economic Development 
- Spatial Inequality
- Decentralization 
- Local Governance 
- Urbanization
- Location Theories
- Land Management and Housing Policy
- Sustainability

## About me

I obtained my Ph.D. in Regional Science at Cornell University in 2023. My dissertation was on Regional Inequality of China, under the supervision of Prof. [Ravi Kanbur](https://www.kanbur.dyson.cornell.edu/), Prof. [Kieran Donaghy](https://aap.cornell.edu/people/kieran-donaghy), and Prof. [Shanjun Li](http://li.dyson.cornell.edu/). 

My **research interests** primarily center around understanding the mechanisms that drive the spatial distribution of economic activity. Specifically, I am interested in exploring the interplay of market and institutional factors that contribute to developing an equilibrium state or achieving a socially optimal outcome concerning spatial inequality and sustainability. For example, my research examines the role of policy instruments in shaping regional economic development and the implications of these policies for regional disparities. I also use quantitative empirical methods to identify causal mechanisms of policy-related economic shocks, with an emphasis on their spatial characteristics. Through this research, I aim to shed light on the complex spatial dynamics of economic activity and inform policy decisions that promote sustainable and equitable development.

Before joining the Ph.D. program, I was a former city and regional planning student in the masterâ€™s program at Cornell University. I also hold a masterâ€™s degree in land use management from the Renmin University of China and a B.E. in land use management from Nanjing Agricultural University.

My interdisciplinary training in economics, geography, urban planning, and public administration has prepared me to approach research questions from a unique perspective. Through my diverse background, I am able to think outside the box and identify critical interconnections between seemingly disparate fields.

In addition to my academic interests, I am closely following the ongoing [renaissance of neuroscience and neurobiology](https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2022/09/21/after-fallow-decades-neuroscience-is-undergoing-a-renaissance), and I am interested in exploring how these fields can dissolve the boundaries between nature and social science. I am also passionate about the latest advancements in AI technology and interested in how they can be used to build a decentralized, democratic architecture in both the internet space and the real world.
