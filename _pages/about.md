I'm Xiaozhong Sun, and I'm currently a Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Geography at Colgate University. 

My research revolves around understanding the mechanisms that drive the spatial distribution of people and economic activity, with a focus on:

- **Geopolitical Process of the Economy of Space**
  * Spatial Inequality & Uneven Regional Development
  * Policy Instruments in Regional Economic Development
  
- **Comparative Geopolitical Systems**
  * Decentralized Governance Structures
  * Administrative Systems & Spatial Policy Implementation
  
- **Human-Environment Interaction**
  * Complex Urban Systems
  * Land Use Change & Environmental Impacts
  
- **Advanced Methodologies**
  * GIS Technology in Remote and Social Sensing
  * Multitemporal Multimodel Data Fusion
  * Machine Learning for Spatial Analysis
 
## Current Research

My current work centers on **studying the dynamic distribution of human economic activities using a multitemporal multimodel data fusion machine learning framework** that integrates social and remote sensing data to measure spatial inequality and environmental impacts of land use change. This research aims to develop a data-driven framework that can monitor real-time social and environmental changes and provide insights for policy-making and sustainable urban planning.

## Teaching

Currently teaching courses in Geography and Environmental Studies at Colgate University, focusing on:
- GIS and Spatial Analysis
- Urban Geography
- Geopolitical Economy

## Education

I obtained my Ph.D. in Regional Science at Cornell University. My dissertation was on Regional Inequality in China, under the supervision of Prof. [Ravi Kanbur](https://www.kanbur.dyson.cornell.edu/), Prof. [Kieran Donaghy](https://aap.cornell.edu/people/kieran-donaghy), and Prof. [Shanjun Li](http://li.dyson.cornell.edu/). 

Before joining the Ph.D. program, I was a former city and regional planning student in the masterâ€™s program at Cornell University. I also hold a masterâ€™s degree in land use management from Renmin University of China and a B.E. in land use management from Nanjing Agricultural University. My interdisciplinary training in economics, geography, urban planning, and public administration has prepared me to approach research questions from a unique perspective. My diverse background allows me to think outside the box and identify critical interconnections between seemingly disparate fields.

## Additional Interests

Beyond my core research, I'm fascinated by:
- The [renaissance of neuroscience and neurobiology](https://www.economist.com/technology-quarterly/2022/09/21/after-fallow-decades-neuroscience-is-undergoing-a-renaissance) and its potential to bridge natural and social sciences
- Advancements in AI technology and their applications for building decentralized, democratic architectures
- Sustainable urban development solutions
